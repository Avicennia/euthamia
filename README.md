# euthamia
A simple annual plant mod for Nodecore.  
Adds a plant that is similar (only vaguely so) to *Euthamia graminifolia* (The Grass-leaved Goldenrod) to the game.  

This plant does not require much water, and reproduces via ballochory.  
Harvesting currently only provides fibres (more like foliage than fibres). Some plants will produce more fibres than others; careful selection of when you harvest may prove to help.  

#### Compatibility

Fibres from this plant will be aliased to nc_nature's plant_fiber when both mods are installed.

#### Behaviour Spoilers
Plant growth and seed production can be influenced a little with better soil or adding some inorganic nutrients.
